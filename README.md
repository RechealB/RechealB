Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Recheal. Iâ€™m currently working towards becoming a full stack web developer and an AWS cloud engineer. 
My tech journey began when I enrolled into the AWS re/Start program, an intensive classroom-based program that equips 
students with skills in Linux, python programming, networking, security and relational database management and prepares them for 
cloud engineering roles. 

âš¡ Fun fact: I never thought I would love coding or even consider software engineering as a career but here I am... 
Really...never say never!
